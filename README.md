# -Password-Generator-

## Description 

In this project, I worked on a password generator, where the user clicks to generateÂ  password. It asks you how long you want your password to be and it's between 8 to 128. If it's chosen to be less than 8 and more than 128, the message will pop off, saying it's too short or too long. It asks if you want uppercase letters, lowercase letters, it asks if you want numerics, and lastly, it asks if you want special characters.

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```
## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password

THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
